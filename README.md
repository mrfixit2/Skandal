Skandal
=======

The goal of this project is to create a 3D scanner which can be used to create true to scale objects which can be further used for 3d printing.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NewProggie/Skandal.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/NewProggie/Skandal)

This project requires:
 * Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.6.2+
 * GCC or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++ compiler.
 * Boost C++ Libraries v1.46+
 * Intel Threading Building Blocks v4.2+
 * Qt Framework v4.5+
 * VTK Framework v5.10+
 * OpenCV v2.4+
 * Phidgets Library v2.1+
 * aruco Library v1.2.4+
 * libdc1394 Library v2.2+
 * UnitTest++ (a.k.a. unittest-cpp)

Building
--------

This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, I
have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that
the typical build invocation of "./configure" followed by "make" will work.
For a list of all possible build targets, use the command "make help".

NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

Automatic Deployment
--------------------

I've provided a Vagrantfile for fast and easy setup of the development
environment. So cloning the repository and doing a
```Shell
vagrant up
```
should be enough to get you started. The build directory with a generated
CodeBlocks project file will be located at the desktop folder, inside
the cloned repository and there inside the build folder.
Visit http://www.vagrantup.com/ for further information.
